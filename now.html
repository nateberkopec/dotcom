<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently living in Tokyo.
</p>

<h4>Wishing I had more time to play Factorio</h4>
<p>
  I feel like the Squidward meme watching everyone play Space Age.
</p>
  
<h4>Working with Yuki Nishijima</h4>
<p>
  The Speedshop has it's first employee: Ruby Core Team member Yuki Nishijima!
</p>
  
<h4>Avaiable for work again!</h4>
<p>
  I recently launched a retainer service, and it looks like I'm booked out through the end of 2024. A good problem to have :)
</p>
 
I am:

<ul>
  <li>...thinking about next year's Tour De France.</li>
  <li>...reading The Cherry Orchard by Chekhov</li>
  <li>...off to the UK and Ireland in December.</li>
</ul>
