<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently living in Tokyo.
</p>

<h4>Surprised at how much I use AI</h4>
<p>
  It's basically all day working with the LLM now.
</p>

<h4>I've got a coach!</h4>
<p>
  I'm now working with a professional cycling coach - <a href="https://www.nero.club/coaching">Jesse Coyle from Nero!</a>
</p>

<h4>Working on our retainer clients</h4>
<p>
  Our <a href="https://speedshop.co/retainer.html">retainer service</a> has proved very popular over the last year.
</p>

I am:

<ul>
  <li>...doing a fuckload of LLM-assisted coding. It's like all day long.</li>
  <li>...yet, <i>still</i> not really all that worried about AI taking my job.</li>
  <li>...trying to figure out what game to play next after Frostpunk 2.</li>
</ul>
