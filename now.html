<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently living in Tokyo.
</p>

<h4>Playing some <a href="https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=innovation">Innovation</a> on Board Game Arena</h4>
<p>
  It's so good! What a nice way to stay in touch with my gaming friends.
</p>
  
<h4>Working with Yuki Nishijima</h4>
<p>
  The Speedshop has it's first employee: Ruby Core Team member Yuki Nishijima!
</p>
  
<h4>Avaiable for work again!</h4>
<p>
  I recently launched a retainer service, and it looks like I'm booked out through the end of 2024. A good problem to have :)
</p>
 
I am:

<ul>
  <li>...planning next year's cycling season.</li>
  <li>...reading Tom Clancy's Red Storm Rising for the... third time?</li>
  <li>...off to the UK and Ireland for two weeks this month.</li>
</ul>
