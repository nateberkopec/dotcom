<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently living in Tokyo.
</p>

<h4>Tour de France hyyyype!</h4>
<p>
  It's finally time! If you're unfamiliar with the sport, the Netflix series is an OK introduction.
</p>
  
<h4>Dreading the summer heat</h4>
<p>
  It's quite rough out here from July until September. I'm now intimately familiar with what "wet bulb globe temperature" is.
</p>
  
<h4>Working on our retainer clients</h4>
<p>
  Our <a href="https://speedshop.co/retainer.html">retainer service</a> has proved very popular over the last year.
</p>
 
I am:

<ul>
  <li>...doing a fuckload of LLM-assisted coding.</li>
  <li>...<i>still</i> not really all that worried about AI taking my job.</li>
  <li>...taking my daughter to ballet lessons.</li>
</ul>
