<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently living in Tokyo.
</p>

<h4>My parents are visiting!</h4>
<p>
  Turns out if you send your parents enough pictures of their grandkids, they'll cram themselves into a metal tube for 14 hours.
</p>

<h4>I've got a coach!</h4>
<p>
  I'm now working with a professional cycling coach - <a href="https://www.nero.club/coaching">Jesse Coyle from Nero!</a>
</p>

<h4>Working on our retainer clients</h4>
<p>
  Our <a href="https://speedshop.co/retainer.html">retainer service</a> has proved very popular over the last year.
</p>

I am:

<ul>
  <li>...playing MechWarrior 5.</li>
  <li>...messing around with emulators using one of these new Chinese ~$60 handhelds. EmuDeck was too complex.</li>
  <li>...continually suprised by the abilities of LLMs.</li>
</ul>
