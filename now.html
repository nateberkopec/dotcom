<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently living in Tokyo.
</p>

<h4>Feeling the AGI</h4>
<p>
  I spend my entire day staring at LLM agent windows. My commit count has 10x-ed. Something is happening. I'm not sure what.
</p>

<h4>I've got a coach!</h4>
<p>
  I'm now working with a professional cycling coach - <a href="https://www.nero.club/coaching">Jesse Coyle from Nero!</a>
</p>

<h4>Working on our retainer clients</h4>
<p>
  Our <a href="https://speedshop.co/retainer.html">retainer service</a> has proved very popular over the last year.
</p>

I am:

<ul>
  <li>...making endless reams of LLM "skills".</li>
  <li>...not sleeping very well, as my cycling training has kicked into high gear.</li>
  <li>...loving watching my kids grow up.</li>
</ul>
