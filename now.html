<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently living in Tokyo.
</p>

<h4>Drinking tea and coffee like a... well, not like a fish.</h4>
<p>
  Seriously my dentist should be worried.
</p>
  
<h4>Currently in peak bike race season</h4>
<p>
  I've been riding a lot, most recently in Niseko. Matsumoto has a hill climb coming up. <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/33158316">Follow me on Strava.</a>
</p>
  
<h4>Working on our retainer clients</h4>
<p>
  Our <a href="https://speedshop.co/retainer.html">retainer service</a> has proved very popular over the last year.
</p>
 
I am:

<ul>
  <li>...wishing there was more Andor to watch.</li>
  <li>...not really all that worried about AI taking my job.</li>
  <li>...taking my daughter to ballet lessons.</li>
</ul>
